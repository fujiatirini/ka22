        <p>Pour in the chicken broth and 8 cups water, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. This black eyed peas recipe is smokey, spicy with a deep yet not too overwhelming bacon flavor. This recipe was awesome, the only changes i made was to cut it in half (i was only feeding 2.5 people so we didn&#039;t need a lot) i used 12 oz.</p>
